What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the .gif metadata to follow the commits, but it doesn't have any commits yet. It is needed to make the commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediate place before getting any file to the final commit. It lets you include various files in the same commit at the same time.
