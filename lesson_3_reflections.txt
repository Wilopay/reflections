When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working with different people or from different places that don have acces to your local storage.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because maybe i don't want the changes made to the repository yet, maybe they are not finished or maybe i am working on the same problem.
